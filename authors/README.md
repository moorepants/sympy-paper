## Usage

* Call `./prettify.sh` after modyfing `authors.json`.
* Use `./list_text.py` to list the authors as text
* Use `./list_latex.py` to list the authors as latex source code

## How to add a new author

Send a PR adding a new author into the json file. This PR must be approved by
Anthony Scopatz. We follow the criteria stated in the main
[README file](https://github.com/sympy/sympy-paper/blob/master/README.md#authorship-criteria).
Anthony will make sure that the new author meets all the criteria. For
clear-cut cases (when nobody has any doubts that the criteria have been met),
Anthony will simply merge the PR. For borderline cases, Anthony will consult
the community.
