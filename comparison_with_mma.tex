\subsection{Mathematica}

Wolfram Mathematica is a popular proprietary CAS.\@
It features highly advanced algorithms.
Mathematica has a core implemented in C++~\cite{Wolfram2016}
which interprets its own programming language (know as Wolfram language).

% M-expressions

Analogously to Lisp's S-expressions,
Mathematica uses its own style of M-expressions,
which are arrays of either atoms or other M-expression.
The first element of the expression identifies the type of the expression
and is indexed by zero, whereas the first argument is indexed by one.
Notice that SymPy expression arguments are stored in a Python tuple
(that is, an immutable array),
while the expression type is identified by the type of the object storing the
expression.

% Attributes

Mathematica can associate attributes to its atoms.

% Expression mutability

Unlike SymPy, Mathematica's expressions are mutable,
that is one can change parts of the expression tree without the need of
creating a new object.
The reactivity of Mathematica allows for a lazy updating of any references
to that data structure.

% Products and commutativity

Products in Mathematica are determined by some builtin node types,
such as \texttt{Times}, \texttt{Dot}, and others.
\texttt{Times} is overloaded by the * operator,
and is always meant to represent a commutative operator.
The other notable product is \texttt{Dot}, overloaded by the \texttt{.} operator.
This product represents matrix multiplication,
it is not commutative.
SymPy uses the same node for both scalar and matrix multiplication,
the only exception being with abstract matrix symbols.
Unlike Mathematica, SymPy determines commutativity with respect to
multiplication from the factor's expression type.
Mathematica puts the \texttt{Orderless} attribute on the expression
type.

% Associative expressions.

Regarding associative expressions,
SymPy handles associativity by making associative expressions inherit the
class \texttt{AssocOp},
while Mathematica specifies the \texttt{Flat} attribute on the expression type.

% Pattern matching


%% TODO list:
% * comparison with Mathematica: MatrixExp, product not always commutative, type inheritance (polymorphism) and advantage in unifying the product symbol * for symbols and matrices, pattern matching vs. single dispatch.
% * comparison with Mathematica: commutativity, associative expressions, one-identity. Advantage of SymPy: multiplicative commutativity defined on symbols.
% * comparison with Mathematica: avoid misspelling variables through forced declaration (check that you can't do it in Mathematica).
% * evaluate=False vs HoldForm
% * comparison with Mathematica: == is structural equality, not
% * comparison with Mathematica: polynomial module.
% * comparison with Mathematica: space is product, ** vs ^
% * comparison with Mathematica: ( ) is Sequence, functions are generally uppercase.
% * comparsion with Mathematica: table of comparison?
% * comparison with Mathematica: Wolfram language has loads of operator overloading, functional paradigm.
